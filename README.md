## About
This is a little game I made for the Game Boy Advance. The game was my submission
to the GBA Jam 2022.

While the development caused me some headaches, I enjoyed learning how to program
(although at a very basic level) a game for such a system like the GBA. The one
thing I'll always keep in mind when making another project like this is to pay
attention where things end up being put on memory!
